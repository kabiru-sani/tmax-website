                Rolls-Royce was a British luxury car and later an aero-engine manufacturing business established in 1904 in Manchester 
                by the partnership of Charles Rolls and Henry Royce. Building on Royce's good reputation established with his cranes, 
                they quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering by manufacturing the "best car in the world". The business 
                was incorporated as Rolls-Royce Limited in 1906, and a new factory in Derby was opened in 1908. The First World War 
                brought the company into manufacturing aero-engines. Joint development of jet engines began in 1940, and they entered 
                production. Rolls-Royce has built an enduring reputation for development and manufacture of engines for defence and civil aircraft.

                The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the 
                family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the 
                family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets, but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and 
                avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 
                cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]
